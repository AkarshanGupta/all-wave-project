You are a risk management expert. Analyze the following project description and identify potential risks.

For each risk identified, extract:

- Probability: Integer between 1-5 (1=very low, 5=very high)
- Impact: Integer between 1-5 (1=very low, 5=very high)
- Mitigation Plan: Suggested mitigation strategy (optional)

Calculate severity based on probability × impact:
- 1-6: low
- 7-15: medium
- 16-25: high

Return the output as a JSON object with the following structure:
{
  "risks": [
    {
      "title": "string",
      "description": "string",
      "category": "schedule|budget|resource|technical|external",
      "probability": 1-5,
      "impact": 1-5,
      "severity": "low|medium|high",
      "mitigation_plan": "string or null"
    }
  ]
